# INN-Hotels
Analyse the data of INN Hotels to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be cancelled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

INN Hotels Group with a chain of hotels in Portugal, are facing problems with high number of booking cancellations and require data-driven solutions.
Booking cancellations impact hotels in revenue loss, additional operations cost, profit margin reduction, etc
New technology-driven online booking channels have dramatically changed customers’ booking possibilities and typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc

Objective of this project is to analyse data containing different attributes of customers’ booking details and :
- Find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations
- Build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be cancelled in advance, and
- Formulate profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

This analysis will be conducted by using different techniques such as Decision trees and logistics regression to build models for the booking cancellation predictions.
